A growing suite of scripts I find useful


#### rename.sh

This is a batch renaming script which will loop through a directory of files and rename them to an incrementing set of numbers. eg:

`DCIM_0273.jpg, DCIM_0245.jpg, DCIM_3713.jpg` > `0001.jpg, 0002.jpg, 0003.jpg`

Simply add the containing directory path and filetype to edit at the top and run the script with:

`$bash rename.sh`
